firmware files for this build are located here https://github.com/wlard/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/w60

Notes before you start to replicate this build:
the 2 switches located under the microcontoller are using the hotswap sockets without the wing part but i also cutoff the top wireguides before printing those in the slic3r

if you get keys sending a keystroke twice then most likely a wire is loose or the connection in the hotswap socket is not secure an easy way to fix this is to remove the switch and bend the legs of the switch about 10 degrees this will be addressed in a future update of the hotswap sockets but is not implemented yet.
